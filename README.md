# Sign Up Form

A basic sign up form made for practicing HTML and CSS concepts.

## Mockup

This was the mockup I followed for the creation of this page:

## New (to me) Concepts

This project made use of a couple of things that were new to me and fun to learn about:
- form styling
- styling a background image
- constraint validation API
- use of a media query

It had also generally been a while since I've written any HTML/CSS/JS, so it was good to knock some rust off.
